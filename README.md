* HTML, CSS and Javascript (AJAX) used for front-end development
* Express server used for back-end development of the server
* MySQL used to create the database which is used to store the user credentials

### Key Learnings Outcomes: 

1. Understand principles of basic client and Server.
2. Simple Demonstration of database integration with the server.
3. Implementation of GET and POST HTTP request.
